Mini means Mini-Projects. All running on donohoe.io/projects. But since Mini was available as a repo name I stopped typing there.

These projects were at various points quick and dirty hacked together projects to demo or explore an idea. They exemplify the least care and attention in terms of coding, coding standards, horrible class names, and dubious approaches.

However they were/are fun and work.
